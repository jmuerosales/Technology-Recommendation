                    <p class="p1">As a student living in the 21st century, we tend to rely on the use of technology in living 
                        throughout our daily lives. However, how many of us can utilize it to the best of our ability to grow as a
                        person? Many of us feel like we are not enough and are lost on what we want to do. We keep saying that we
                        want to be better but lack the grit and zeal to move. This may serve as an inspiration to you as it does not only 
                        talk about technology but also life lessons that you may apply to your life.
