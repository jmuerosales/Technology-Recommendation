                The Right Mindset and Way to use Facebook
            </h1>
            <p class="p2">
                Many of us spend our time on social media websites, and it is not actually too bad if you effectively use that time to learn new things which you 
                can use to improve yourself. As we commit ourselves that we wanted to grow and develop ourselves so that we may acquire what our hearts desire, we 
                will find ways to improve ourselves even in the smallest form as we do it continuously and non-stop growing. Facebook is a great software technology 
                that can be used in great ways if done with a dedicated mind. First, you must find what you really want to do, and given the uses of this software; 
                you will find a way to be more successful by utilizing this technology. With the diversity and community supporting Facebook, you will find a place 
                you want to be and will be comfortable with.

                helpful towards our career especially if you are in the CS or IT field. It is usually reccommended by those who have experiene to create your own page,
                channel, or website that will serve as your work so the employer may know you better.

                thing in my newsfeed that is informative and can learn new things from it. It is like a community of same-minded people that is very beneficial towards 
                our growth. It is reccommended that we join groups that are helpful towards our future careers!

                Inspiration for the Chosen Software Technology
            </h1>
            <img class="picinspiration"src = "Images/Mark.png">
            <p class="p2">
                One of the things I do love the most is reading, as I learn a lot especialy if I am reading the lives of other people. The life of Mark Zuckerberg,
                known for co-founding the tech giant Facebook has been inspiring me for years as he became a billionaire. Did you know that he didn't finished his
                college degree when he created this amazing technology called Facebook? However many doesn't know that he is quite active during his high school
                days where he  worked under a company named Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. He also created some 
                computer games that kids played as he began using computer and writing software during his middle school days. All of his success right now didn't 
                came from a fruit falling into the ground, it was due to all his hardwork. When he started to plan and discuss creating facebook to his friends, he 
                invited 5 people to his dorm, however only 2 people showed up. If he lost his confidence back then as less than half of the people he invited showed up
                then we will not have facebook accounts which is very helpful towards our daily lives in all aspects. 
            </p>
                
            <p class="p2">We can see that he loves what he is doing and worked hard in order to achieve what he has right now. Next is we can see that he is starting 
                to make his new project as he changed the name of his company from facebook to metaverse. Facebook is known as a social media that connects people
                visually using the internet, metaverse on the other hand focuses on creating a new world (virtually) where people can connect more of like a character
                in a video game in an open world where they can go anywhere, conduct virtual meetings similar to face to face in reality as we can move our avatars
                inside that virtual world and can change places unlike the current zoom where we can only see ourselves and changes the background behind us. We can see
                that despite the great success he has achieved, he is not stopping and continues to exlore more the potential of technology spending his time and effort 
                to succeed in whatever he is planning. 
                Lastly, he is quite inspiring as he is also known for being a philanthropist where he and his 
                wife pledged to donate 99% of their Facebook shares to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, an organization where its main area is to help Science, Education,
                Justice, Opportunity, Health. Its primary goal is to build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone.
