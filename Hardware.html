            <h2 class="stepsfont"> The Invention of Technology : Monitor </h2>
            <p class="p2">The progress of technology throughout the years have brought us many advantages. We can see the same thing even though we are all in 
                different parts of the world and it may also be in real time. The monitor or screens have brought us a new scenery due to the animations made 
                that can be seen on these technologies. It also helps us to be more creative as we see new things and things we want to focus with. We can call, 
                watch, even browse things that we want depending on our monitor as some monitor this days are televisions since it is easy to connect it. We can easily
                connect our televisions or monitors with the use of use HDMI connectors, and wireless with the use of bluetooth! There are also projectors where we can 
                see without taking up too much space or hassle. The monitors are very helpful so that we can see or a wider audience can see what we want to watch or 
                show everyone. There are also studies where seeing it visually with pictures or videos can make us learn more comprehensively whatever we want to learn.

                THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING A TELEVISION OR MONITORS:
            </h1>

            <h2 class="stepsfont">Step 1. Purpose
            </h2>
            <img class="picsteps"src = "Images/TV2.png">
            <p class="p2"> When buying a screen, we should consider on what we would like to do with it. For example, if we want it to be used as 
                a television for our living room as we watch things in a comfortable position, then we would have to consider the size and where 
                we would place it. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="stepsfont">Step 2. Specifications
            </h2>
            <img class="picsteps"src = "Images/TV0.png">
            <p class="p2"> When looking for the right monitor, we should first research on what is suitable and for the price we would like to buy 
                it for. We should also consider reading online reviews, reccomendations and watching promotions in order to choose the best that would 
                suit for our wants and needs.  Different brands also offers different strengths and weaknesses in their products. Make sure to find 
                the most suitable for your use.
            </p>

            <h3 class="stepsfont1">
                <li> Connection Ports
                </li>
            </h3>
            <img class="picsteps"src = "Images/TV1.png">
            <p class="p2"> As mentioned in the first step, we should find out what is the purpose of our screen would be. Therefore, we should consider
                asking if the port is available on the said screen. Usually screens have HDMI ports but it has different forms and uses as newer versions 
                mostly uses the higher version of ports. We should also consider what kind of USB port is our television supporting. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="stepsfont1">
                <li> Screen Resolution
                </li>
            </h3>
            <img class="picsteps"src = "Images/TV3.png">
            <p class="p2"> Television this days that are being sold is usually at full HD (1980x1080) or 1080p at minimum. We should consider also what 
                kind of screen will be your tv would have: LCD, LED, AMOLED. This would create differences in colors, brightness, contrast etc. 
                Keep in mind that the higher the resolution, usually the more expensive it is. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="stepsfont1">
                <li> Refresh Rate
                </li>
            </h3>
            <img class="picsteps"src = "Images/TV4.png">
            <p class="p2"> If the primary use of the screen is for gaming, we should look for those with higher refresh rates as it may affect your 
                gaming experience. The lower the refresh rate, the slower and more blurry your video/ graphic quality would be. If you are using Tv's
                for casual reasons, then go for higher resolutions instead.
            </p>

            <h3 class="stepsfont1">
                <li> Power Consumption
                </li>
            </h3>
            <img class="picsteps"src = "Images/TV5.png">
            <p class="p2"> Of course it is important! Aside from saving money with the less and more effective use of electricity, we would be saving 
                our environment as there would be less power consumption with it. We should take a look at how many Kilowatt per hour and how much 
                would that increase the cost of our electricity.

                Inspiration for the Chosen Software Technology

                I took into consideration what I have experienced as I learn a lot easier when seeing or watching rather than someone explaining it to me. The power of 
                visualization with the use of monitors in various forms are very helpful towards learning whether it is for school or personal reasons. It is also a great 
                source of entertainment as you watch and unwind yourselves, rest is also part of learning as you need to take a break sometimes in order to function properly.
                I still remeber the days where there the monitors or televisions are called CRT TV's and is box-shaped, the quality back then feels so clear to me back then,
                however nowadays we can see the difference especially if your screen is equiped with LED/ AMOLED technology that is more common nowadays whether it is 
                for a mobile device screen or monitors. With the advancement of technology in terms of animation, the content creators alongside 
                with the animators are doing their best to make ideas that are creative and more detailed that makes it more entertaining and 
                easier to absorb information.
