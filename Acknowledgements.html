        Authorâ€™s Personal Message of Acknowledgement:
    </h1>
        <p class="p2">
            I would like to thank all the factors that gave inspiration for me to create this message to those who have read the contents of this website.  
            First, I would like to thank my teacher, Ms. Maridel Negradas for giving me an opportunity to think in-depth by giving this task to our class individually 
            for our final output in the subject Introduction to Computing. This output is made based on my personality as I personally think and do things this way 
            that made me think critically and more precisely on what I personally believe in. I used wallpaperaccess.com for all the pictures I used, as I regularly 
            download my wallpapers on my laptop on this website. I would like to acknowledge the Wikipedia for help of giving me a detailed 
            summary of what I have learned about Mark Zuckerberg through various videos and news scattered online that served as an inspiration to 
            me when I was young until today and will into the future as his success was something that can makes me want to move forward and keep
            going. Without all these factors, I would not be able to create this website. I will strive to grow further throughout the time I will
            be spending as a college student in my character development, programming skills, and competencies that are needed in daily life. 
        </p>

        <p class="p2">
            To those whom are viewing this, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to all of you as you accompany me in adventuring how the modern technology
            such as the software where we have discussed the potential and uses of Facebook alongside with the hardware technology where the power of visual learning 
            appeared that can be gained through the use of monitors. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Until next time! Keep safe and may the grace of God bless you and your family always!
            <br>
