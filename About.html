                An Overview on the Use of Modern Technology <br>
                (John Paolo Rosales's Point-of-View)
        </h1>
            <p class="p2">
            Many of us are using or at least have heard of the development and uses of technology globally. 
            This technology affects us one way or another, it may be beneficial or not depending on how we use it. 
            Many of us use it to connect with other people, entertainment, work, studies, news, etc. Some of us are 
            spending most of our time immersed in the use of modern technology that makes some of us productive while 
            others are not. This can only be determined by how our mind perceives what we are doing or what we sought 
            to do while using this so-called modern technology. 
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
            As a fellow student, I believe that most of us are using technology, more specifically computers, and mobile phones
            for entertainment purposes such as gaming, social medias, and watching dramas. Sometimes we are using it sometimes for schoolwork
            when assigned to do so. However, there can be many uses of technology aside from entertainment, or you can make
            entertainment work the same way as you are doing what you feel like when doing schoolwork!
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
            You might be wondering how you can make doing schoolwork entertaining as many of us really cannot see how doing it
            will be significantly helpful towards our future life that leads is in lacking zeal in doing it. Each subject has their
            own purpose if we continually immerse ourselves into it. Some teaches us the value of patience, improves our critical thinking,
            while some improve our skills such as the English subject where we improve our literary and communications
            skills that are very important during our time as a student and in the proffesional fielf. There will be a time where we will be tasked 
            to be in an intern where we will create reports and we must have learned how to properly converse so we may perform well. What we are 
            doingin school is preparation when we enter the professional world where only those who can perform well will succeed. 
            The definition of success can vary from person, but there is one thing in common that each successful person does have,
            and it is happiness.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
            We cannot be happy if we are do not have a sense of contentment as we will only see the things we have as normal and will
            not be able to appreciate anything else. How can we be happy if we cannot do things that we want? Doing our schoolwork with 
            appreciation and zeal is one thing and we can improve our performance tremendously by utilizing our time by using and using it 
            alongside the use of modern technology.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
            We can learn anything with modern technology that makes it powerful. As you read this, it means that you have access to technology 
            which means that you have access to become powerful.  Many of us have watched shows like movies, dramas, anime, etc. and we can see
            that many protagonists are very powerful in their own right. Some have overwhelmingly high influence towards their domain just like 
            a king or an emperor, some are very powerful and well-known with the usage of magic or swordsmanship, some are very talented in their 
            own respective field such as arts, cooking, sports, music. Do you want to have your own specialty where you can also be like a 
            protagonist in a show? Then you must have the desire and thirst in your heart to obtain it and move to gain knowledge and learn more 
            about yourself. One of the keys to that path in our world is on how much we utilize the use of technology. Join me and to explore how 
            we can effectively utilize more the use of technology!
